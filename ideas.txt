info from the song:
- ratings
- category

info from the artist:
- origin
- activity years

need to think how:
- how to process the opening, transitions chords


if the data is too big - we can save if as raw rows separated by tabs and not by json file


refactoring tasks:
- create driver helper
- refactor song's categories
- change the data struct (parse better) of author and composer
- artist collaborators - we can make this at the end of the crawling to be a list - by looking for words that starts
  with " ×•" and checking to see if there is an artist with this name....
